## Version Control

v0.0.1 - 2024-06-01: Original version without commands

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The following packages are required:

- discord.py==2.3.2
- python-dotenv==1.0.1

### Installation

As this bot currently is not being hosted, you will need to clone the repository and host it yourself via your prefered platform:

`git clone https://github.com/ichbinjade/loki-discord-bot`

### Populating the env file

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and populate the relevant variables:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN=` : This will be your bot's token from the developer portal
- `COMMAND_PREFIX=""` : While slash commands are popular, I still prefer using "!" prefixes

## Commands

Coming soon!
